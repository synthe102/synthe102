### Hi ! I'm Léonard 👋

I'm a software engineer from France 🇫🇷🥖, my current interests are in cloud native infrastructure, particularly kubernetes and bare-metal server management. I enjoy building dumb stuff and self-hosting services on my [Homelab](https://github.com/synthe102/homelab).
I have 5 years of experience building, running and operating infrastructure on public cloud and on-prem.

Currently working at [Mistral AI](https://mistral.ai), building Mistral Compute, a bare-metal GPU cloudprovider with turn key HPC capabilities.
